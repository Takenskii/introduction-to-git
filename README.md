This repository was created to accomplish an assignment for learning git features using bash terminal in Linux OS system. 
The following actions were taken in order to do the task using Linux terminal with the help of git commands
   1. A prearranged repository was cloned into working directory.
   2. The new txt file named "file1.txt" was created, staged, committed with the relevant comments and finally pushed into the remote repository.
   3. A new branch called "feature" was generated and a file "file2.txt" was intialized then staged, committed and ultimately pushed into the remote repository
   4. Lastly created branch "feature" was merged with the main branch
   5. A new branch "bugfix" was organized and a file "file1.txt" was exposed to some changes by adding a new line of text, all changes were stahed, commited and pushed
   6. Finally, a .gitignore file was added into the repo where all files with .log extension were ignored

This assignment was extremely advantageous for acquiring knowledge in git techniques and git commands
